          <p class="paragraph">Our client, the Washington Trail Association (WTA) is the largest nonprofit hiking organization in Washington that aims to protect, promote, and expand access to hiking trails in Washington. Over the course of 10 weeks, we formed a team of 3 to evaluate their website, which is a hub for users to gather information about hikes, volunteering opportunities, and many more. Based on our findings, we delivered recommendation for our client to redesign the site features with usability issues.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-7 heading-3">What parts of the website should we focus on?</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">We looked into the effectiveness of features including find hikes, save hikes for later viewing, and directions to those hikes. We also evaluated the effectiveness towards users’ motivation towards volunteering or donating for the organization.<br><br>More specifically, we researched the following questions:</p>

            <p class="paragraph">First, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to familiarize with the site’s features and look out for any initial usability issues. This evaluation was originally based on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" class="link-26">Jakob Nielsens’s 10 General Principles</a> for Interaction Design. By using these principles, we were able to ask questions about what the WTA website provided versus our own expectations. From this depth of analysis, we started making the set of research questions.</p>

          <div class="div-block-17">
            <p class="paragraph">In order to test the site, we conducted usability sessions by making a series of requests to the participant. Below, are the requests followed with the expected action of the participant, and the rationale for each.</p>
          </div>
          <ol class="ordered-list">
            <li>
              <p class="paragraph-6"><strong>Express your thoughts on the homepage</strong><br>Justification: We wanted to know what caught their attention and what didn’t, what they gravitated to, and also get a feel for their intuition about what elements in the page might be interactive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="paragraph-6"><strong>Find a hike</strong><br>Justification: What we were interested in seeing is how the participants proceeded from here. There is no clearly labeled “Log In” button visible on the page! Only by mousing over the “My Backpack” button does a drop-down menu appear that contains an option for logging in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="paragraph-6"><strong>Find driving instructions</strong><br>Justification: This task let us observe the taking of one of three different routes: the written directions under the embedded Google Map satisfies the participant, the tiny “See Larger Map” button under the embedded map is clicked, or the a third option outside of WTA is used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="paragraph-6"><strong>Save a trail for later viewing</strong><br>Justification: Considering that many hikers are not likely to be looking for a hike within minutes of being available, and that the climate of the Pacific Northwest tends to offer interesting and sudden variations in calm and very damp, having a feature that allows a chosen hike to be saved to an account to be reviewed on another day seems not only tasteful, but necessary. By testing this feature, the participant would completing a lifecycle of one of the primary purposes of the WTA website: Find Hike → Refined Search →  Save it for later. Ensuring that this feature is usable is a necessity.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="flow" class="div-block-12">
          <h2 class="heading-3">Findings &amp; Recommendations</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Below is our list of findings, ordered by task. We ranked them on a scale from 1 - 4 and labeled each issue with the corresponding level of severity in brackets.<br>Level [1] : a substantial number of hikers were unable to start or complete a task. <br>Level [2] : the issue blocks a substantial number of hikers from an important feature or task. <br>Level [3] : hikers are hindered from accomplishing a task or goal.<br>Level [4] : the issue is mildly frustrating or inconsistencies with visuals of the hike.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>Finding 1: User takes different paths to find a hike [4]</strong><br>Instead of clicking the “Find a Hike” button, users took different paths to select a trail. One user selected “hike finder map,” one chose “seasonal hikes,” and another selected the “hike of the week.” Only two participants found a hike by clicking the “Find a Hike” button.<br><br>Since every user successfully navigated to a desired hike, this usability issue is rated as the lowest severity. However, we can streamline the process with some simple design recommendations.Recommendation: We recommend relabeling the tabs within the “Find a Hike” feature for consistency and clarity.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>Finding 2: Confusion with advanced hike search [3]</strong><br>1. Region Search Feature<br>Participants thought they knew which region was closest to them, so they selected from the region list. However, participants selected different regions despite being in the same location. One participant selected “Puget Sound and Islands” and another clicked “Snoqualmie Region.”Recommendation: Since one participant expressed their knowledge of these regions, we suggest to keep the region search. We also recommend that the hike search include an option to return results by distance. The feature would automatically get a user&#x27;s’ location, then filter results by distance from that location. Also, a button to “view on hiking map,” should show the returned results on the hike finder map.          <br>2. Features List [2]<br>When we asked participants to find a hike that was rocky and they could swim in, they immediately started clicking on the boxes in the features list. They understood that they should select features like “rivers” or “lakes,” but they were not sure if they were creating a search that included all of those options, or only some of them. They did not know if the search would return results for rivers AND lakes, or rivers OR lakes. Participants also did not know how search for a rocky hike, since there was no option for that, so they required some hints to create a successful return result. One participant thought to search for “rocky” as a keyword, but they were unsure of which of the two search bars to type it into.<br>Finally, two participants selected criteria that was too specific to return any results. They clicked mileage, elevation, and other various criteria that can be seen in the screen capture below (figure 6). When no search results came up, there was no error message helped them refine their search.<br><br>Recommendation: We recommend that “[#] Search Results” text beneath the search box to automatically update when features and other search criteria are selected. If the number of hikes returned automatically updated, then users would understand which selections limit their search results. They would also understand that selecting from the features list means the result will include all of those features, meaning they are searching for “rivers” AND “lakes.” We also recommend that the hike search only includes one search box.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>Finding 3: Unable to find driving directions [3]</strong><br>The page features an embedded google map with a trail, but it does not provide an easy way to get directions from a user&#x27;s location to the trailhead. Users were unable to use the Map &amp; Directions section to find specific directions from their location to the trailhead without guidance from the moderator. Most participants said they would have just searched for the trail on their phone without using the embedded map. In order for participants to find the “View larger map” link, the moderator had to give them multiple hints. Only three participants clicked the view larger map option, which links to an external google maps page that allows for direction input. Some participants said they found value in the specific driving directions because it would help them find the trailhead, others said they would not use it.<br>Recommendations: Include embedded google map directions search, which we demonstrate in the image above. In addition, the “view larger map” text should say “open in Google Maps” to clarify its function. Also, we recommend making icon and text large.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>Finding 4: Site Aesthetics [3]<br></strong>1. Cluttered homepageParticipants complained about sidebar and all of the different widgets on the homepage.  A screenshot of the current WTA homepage.<br>Recommendations: To simplify the homepage seen on the right, we suggest eliminating the sidebar. This would expand the left section and make it seem less cluttered. <br>Also, based on participant suggestions, we recommend making the site photos larger and more of the focus the page. In addition, the homepage could include a section with photos of trails before and after volunteers work on them. This section would fit nicely with the photo-centered sections already on the page. It might also motivate some users to volunteer or donate. <br><br>2. Inconsistent color scheme and text<br>Participants noted that the page has too many colors: orange, blue, green, red, black, white. One participant complained that titles with the same level of hierarchy have different colors. Recommendations: We recommend rewriting the website CSS style sheet to create a consistent color and font scheme, clarifying textual hierarchy.</p>

        <div id="testing" class="div-block-12">
          <h2 class="heading-3">Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">While users were successfully able to find hikes using the WTA site, finding specific hikes with criteria was challenging. It was unclear how to find driving directions to the hike, and the overall aesthetic of the site was inconsistent and distracting.By following our recommendations of tweaking some aspects of the “Find a Hike” feature, improving the driving directions, and creating a more cohesive visual design, the WTA will attract more users, and encourage increased participation in exploring and volunteering in the outdoors.</p>
